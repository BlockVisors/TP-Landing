',\r\n    description:\r\n      \" There are certain tax advantages to investing in commercial real estate.  Investors can participate in the depreciation of an asset.  In many cases, the depreciation can be accelerated by an accounting technique called cost segregation.  This technique can increase immediate cash-flow and is an example of the general principle of 'a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow'.  This depreciation can be used to 'shield' cash flow from rental income.  The depreciation is of course recaptured when the property is sold, but it is taxed at the Section 1250 gain rate of 25%.  In addition, when the property is sold and there is a true capital gain, the gains are taxed at the long term capital gain rate which is usually lower than the ordinary income rate.  The pass-through nature of the sponsor’s company (usually an LLC or a limited partnership) together with that of the Tokenprop LLC allows investors to enjoy the tax benefits of direct real estate ownership; this is a significant difference between our “direct participation” structures and REITs, for example, which don’t feature all the benefits of a direct pass-through. These tax benefits can include depreciation, mortgage interest, and other deductions that often offset (sometimes entirely) the actual distributable cash — so that investors may receive distributions throughout the year and yet may have little or no taxable income. Much or all of this tax advantage is subject to “recapture” at a later date, however, at the time that the property is sold; nevertheless, the tax deferral benefit of real estate equity investments can be a significant one. \",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 12,\r\n    title: ' Do we pay taxes for the Capital gains we make in the Investment?

Daily traders on PropX are more likely to be interested in the value of the Token which is determined by Supply and Demand, instead of the inherent dividend a particular Property Token offers. There will also be Tokens that are paying out dividends already, for such tokens it is important to know the below dates, which are all also embedded on the Tokens: 1) Date of Dividend declaration, this is the date when the Property LLC declares the date of Dividend distribution.   2) Date of Last Cum-dividend, the date up-to which the tokens can be bought on PropX and be eligible to receive dividend is called the Last cum-dividend date.   3) Ex-date, The ex-date usually precedes the record date by about two. On or after this date, the Property Tokens will trade without its dividend. the buyer of the Tokens on or after the ex-date will not be eligible for the dividends. However, if you sell tokens on the ex-date, you will still be eligible for dividends.  4) Record date - The record date is the day on which the company looks at its records to see who its Token holders are (Wallets).  5) Date of Dividend payment.
